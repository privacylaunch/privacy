You have to take responsibility for what you post.\n          <br />\n          4, please reffer to our community guidelines and safety tips for\n          additional Dos and Don'ts and information on styling safe. <br />\n          <h4 className=\"mt-3\">Privacy policy:</h4>\n          What information does partylive process? <br />\n          Partylive is meeting place for adults, and we provide that service by\n          operating a social network site offering users by joining partylive ,\n          you enter a legal agreement with us and we process your data in order\n          to provide your service under the terms of that agreement.

You also have the\n          opportunity to provide other details about yourself, but these are\n          optional. Because you control your user profile these details are\n          available to you at any time by accessing your profile page, which\n          gives you the chance to correct or update (other than your email\n          address or gender) your information at any time by just logging in to\n          partylive. Please be careful about posting sensitive details about\n          yourself on your Profile such as your religious denomination and\n          health details. While you may voluntarily provide this information to\n          us when you create your Profile, including your sexual preferences and\n          ethnic background, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember\n          that photographs or any video clips that you post on Wheru may reveal\n          these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload and choose\n          to tell us sensitive data about yourself, you are explicitly\n          consenting to our processing your information and making this public\n          to other users. For safety and security and to ensure you have the\n          best possible user experience, we require users to verify their\n          accounts and might ask for your phone number. We want to make sure you\n          are not a robot! And we also want to avoid fake accounts being created\n          which can be used for malicious activities and cyber crime – they\n          threaten the Wheru network and spoil things for everyone. We use a\n          third party provider for account verification who will keep your phone\n          number for up to 90 days for fraud identification purposes. We collect\n          and use your phone number on the basis of our legitimate interests\n          identified above and for the prevention of fraud. To prevent abuse of\n          the app/site, partylive uses automated decisions and moderators to\n          block accounts as part of its moderation procedures. In order to do\n          this, we check accounts and messages for content that indicates\n          breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. This is done through a\n          combination of automated systems and our team of moderators. If an\n          account or message meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the\n          Terms and Conditions of Use are likely to have been breached, the\n          relevant account will automatically be blocked. All users of accounts\n          that have been blocked will be notified that their account has been\n          blocked and affected users can contact Wheru to contest the decision.\n          Finally, we want to keep in touch with you to make sure you know about\n          the great promotions and offers we have available.

The table below provides an overview of the legal bases that\n          partylive relies on to use your data. Where the legal basis is\n          consent, you can withdraw consent at any time.
